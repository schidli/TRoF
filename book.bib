  abstract = {Extreme rainfall events are the major driver of shallow landslide occurrences in mountainous and steep terrain regions around the world. Subsurface hydrology has a dominant role on the initiation of rainfall-induced shallow landslides, since changes in the soil water content affect significantly the soil shear strength. Rainfall infiltration produces an increase of soil water potential, which is followed by a rapid drop in apparent cohesion. Especially on steep slopes of shallow soils, this loss of shear strength can lead to failure even in unsaturated conditions before positive water pressures are developed. We present HYDROlisthisis, a process-based model, fully distributed in space with fine time resolution, in order to investigate the interactions between surface and subsurface hydrology and shallow landslides initiation. Fundamental elements of the approach are the dependence of shear strength on the three-dimensional (3-D) field of soil water potential, as well as the temporal evolution of soil water potential during the wetting and drying phases. Specifically, 3-D variably saturated flow conditions, including soil hydraulic hysteresis and preferential flow phenomena, are simulated for the subsurface flow, coupled with a surface runoff routine based on the kinematic wave approximation. The geotechnical component of the model is based on a multidimensional limit equilibrium analysis, which takes into account the basic principles of unsaturated soil mechanics. A series of numerical simulations were carried out with various boundary conditions and using different hydrological and geotechnical components. Boundary conditions in terms of distributed soil depth were generated using both empirical and process-based models. The effect of including preferential flow and soil hydraulic hysteresis was tested together with the replacement of the infinite slope assumption with the multidimensional limit equilibrium analysis. The results show that boundary conditions play a crucial role in the model performance and that the introduced hydrological (preferential flow and soil hydraulic hysteresis) and geotechnical components (multidimensional limit equilibrium analysis) significantly improve predictive capabilities in the presented case study.},

  abstract = {This article describes an investigation on runoff generation at different scales in the forested catchment of the Sperbelgraben in the Emmental region (Swiss Prealps) where studies in the field of forest hydrology have a history of 100 years. It focuses on the analysis of soil profiles and the subsequent sprinkling experiments above them (1 m2), as well as on surface runoff measurements on larger plots (50 to 110 m2). In the Sperbelgraben investigation area, two very distinct runoff reactions could be observed. On the one hand, very high production of saturation overland flow was registered on wet areas of gleyic soils, with runoff coefficients between 0·39 and 0·94 for profile irrigation. On the other hand, almost no surface runoff was measured on Cambisols, with the exception at some sites of a hydrophobic reaction detected at the beginning of storms after dry periods (coefficients for profile irrigation: 0·01–0·16). This pattern was observed during 1 m2 soil plot irrigation and on surface runoff plots. Apart from a less distinctive signal of the water-repellent litter layer on the larger surface runoff plots, the dominant hydrological processes at the two scales are the same. The determined runoff reaction at the two scales corresponds well with information from a forest site type map describing soil and vegetation characteristics and used as a substitute for a soil map in this study. Theoretical considerations describing forest influence on flood discharge are discussed and evaluated to be in good agreement with observations. These findings are a sound foundation for application in hydrological catchment modelling. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {We test the behaviour of two statistical avalanche models and three hydraulic-continuum models of varying dimensionality against five reference events. For the hydraulic models, reference friction coefficients are produced that replicate the runout distance of the historical event. The model sensitivity to friction coefficients, release depth, release area and runout distance is also analysed. The hydraulic-continuum models yield similar reference coefficients on the simplest topography, but diverge for more complex paths, highlighting the importance of boundary conditions on model performance. The Coulomb friction (Î¼) shows a closer relation to runout distance than the turbulent friction (Î¾). For models of this type, the debris deposition pattern is useful for selecting model coefficients, rather than relying purely on runout distances. The results of the sensitivity analysis are site-specific, again highlighting the importance of terrain as a model boundary condition. The release area seems to have less of an influence on model results than the fracture height and Î¾. In general, the models are most sensitive to Î¼. At the end of the paper, we propose a scheme for avalanche hazard zoning that integrates the statistical and dynamic models, such that zoning can be undertaken with some confidence in model output.},

After a calibration period, two of the small watersheds were treated while the third remained untreated (control). Analysis indicated that peakflow increases following treatments were dependent upon peakflow magnitude. Peakflow increases averaged approximately 13–16\% after treatment for 1-yr recurrence interval events, and 6–9\% for 5-yr recurrence interval events. For the six large basins, multiple linear regression analyses of peakflows relative to: (1) peakflow magnitude; and (2) difference in percent area harvested provided mixed results. While significant (p{$<$}0.05) relationships were found in half of the analyses, the explained variance (Δr2) due to harvesting was generally small (1–7\%).},

The component determines when and where landslides occur in a basin in response to time-varying rainfall and snowmelt, the volume of material eroded and released for onward transport, and the impact on basin sediment yield. Derived relationships are used to link the SHETRAN grid resolution (up to 1\,km), at which the basin hydrology and final sediment yield is modelled, to a subgrid resolution (typically around 10\textendash 100\,m) at which landslide occurrence and erosion is modelled. The subgrid discretization, landslide susceptibility and potential landslide impact are determined in advance using a geographic information system (GIS), with SHETRAN then providing information on temporal variation in the factors controlling landsliding. The ability to simulate landslide sediment yield is demonstrated by a hypothetical application based on a catchment in Scotland.},

  abstract = {Complex and rugged topography induces large variations in erosion and sediment delivery in the headwaters of alpine catchments. An effective connection of hillslopes with the channel network results in highly efficient sediment transfer processes, such as debris flows. In contrast, morphological conditions producing decoupling of hillslopes from channels (e.g. glacial cirques) may exclude large areas of the catchment from sediment delivery to its lower parts. Moreover, an efficient connection between hillslopes and channel network does not always ensure an effective downstream transfer of sediment. Low-slope channel reaches (e.g. in hanging valleys) cause sediment deposition, which often results in changes of the sediment transport processes, typically from debris flow to streamflow with low bedload and suspended load rates. The availability of high-resolution digital terrain models, such as those derived from aerial LiDAR, improves our capability to quantify the topographic controls on sediment connectivity. A geomorphometric index, based on the approach by Borselli et al. (2008), was developed and applied to assess spatial sediment connectivity in two small catchments of the Italian Alps featuring contrasting morphological characteristics. The results of the geomorphometric analysis were checked against field evidences, showing good performance and thus potential usefulness of the index.},

  abstract = {Debris floods have been defined descriptively as mineral and organic sediment-rich floods, occurring in a steep channel and potentially destabilizing the streambed and banks. While this definition allows one to visualize the process, it does not inform on the mechanics, nor does it recognize different types. We propose to define debris floods as “floods during which the entire bed, possibly barring the very largest clasts, becomes mobile for at least a few minutes and over a length scale of at least 10 times the channel width.” We define the onset of a debris flood by the exceedance of a critical shear stress threshold required to mobilize at least the D84 of bed material. A threefold classification is proposed in which the first type is triggered by the shear stress exceedance. The second is initiated by transition from a debris flow either in the channel or by oblique impact of a debris-flow-prone tributary. In this context we highlight the importance of effective fluid density. The third type is associated with outbreak floods from artificial or natural dams. A further subdivision of debris floods is made by using the ratio of the actual shear stress to the critical shear stress, with higher values indicating damaging and finally catastrophic debris floods in which even preexisting channel bank and bed protection is mobilized. This contribution aims to provide a more succinct mechanistic definition of debris floods that can be implemented in hazard and risk assessments for steep streams and rivers.},

  abstract = {Some relatively straightforward modifications to the Distributed Hydrology\textendash Soil\textendash Vegetation Model (DHSVM) are described that allow it to represent urban hydrological processes. In the modified model, precipitation that falls on impervious surfaces becomes surface runoff, and a spatially varying (depending on land cover) fraction of surface runoff is connected directly to the stream channel, with the remainder stored and slowly released to represent the effects of stormwater detention. The model was evaluated through application to Springbrook Creek watershed in a partially urbanized area of King County, Washington. With calibration, the modified DHSVM simulates hourly streamflow from these urbanized catchments quite well. It is also shown how the revised model can be used to study the effects of continuing urbanization in the much larger Puget Sound basin. Model simulations confirm many previous studies in showing that urbanization increases peak flows and their frequency, and decreases peak flow lag times. The results show that the urbanization parameterizations for DHSVM facilitate use of the model for prediction and/or reconstruction of a range of historic and future changes in land cover that will accompany urbanization as well as other forms of vegetation change.

  abstract = {The estimation of runout distances on fans has a major role in assessing debris-flow hazards. Different methods have been devised for this purpose: volume balance, limiting topographic methods, empirical equations, and physical approaches. Data collected from field observations are the basis for developing, testing, and improving predictive methods, while laboratory tests on small-scale models are another suitable approach for studying debris-flow runout under controlled conditions and for developing predictive equations. This paper analyses the problem of assessing runout distance, focusing on six debris flows that were triggered on July 5th, 2006 by intense rainfall near Cortina d'Ampezzo (Dolomites, north-eastern Italy). Detailed field surveys were carried out immediately after the event in the triggering zone, along the channels, and in the deposition areas. A fine-scale digital terrain model of the study area was established by aerial LiDAR measurements. Total travel and runout distances on fans measured in the field were compared with the results of formulae from the literature (empirical/statistical and physically oriented), and samples of sediment collected from deposition lobes were used for laboratory tests. The experimental device employed in the tests consists of a tilting flume with an inclination from 0° to 38°, on which a steel tank with a removable gate was installed at variable distances from the outlet. A final horizontal plane works as the deposition area. Samples of different volumes and variable sediment concentrations were tested. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess the length of the deposits as a function of both the potential energy of the mass and the sediment concentration of the flow. Our comparison of the results of laboratory tests with field data suggests that an energy-based runout formula might predict the runout distances of debris flows in the Dolomites.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the interaction between condensation, precipitation and evaporation as an integral part of the water cycle under high-mountain conditions. This paper focuses on methods of identification and measurement of condensation under natural conditions in high alpine valleys by example of the Dischma in eastern Switzerland. The role of different vegetation zones in transferring water from and to the atmosphere is investigated above the treeline (1900–2600 m a.s.l.). Field measurements of condensation and evaporation at 10 min intervals show that condensation plays a more significant role in the water cycle than previously assumed. Both diurnal and nocturnal condensation are compared at different altitudes on slope and valley locations during the exceptionally hot and dry mid-summer of 1998. It is suggested that, in addition to standard hydrological components, water balance modelling in mountain zones should include more precise data on measured condensation.

The assessment was based on two different data sets, (a) hazard information providing input to the exposure of elements at risk, and (b) information on the building stock combined from different spatial data available on the national level. Hazard information was compiled from two different sources. For torrential flooding and snow avalanches available local-scale hazard maps were used, and for river flooding the results of the countrywide flood modelling eHORA were available. Information on the building stock contained information on the location and size of each building, as well as on the building category and the construction period. Additional information related to the individual floors, such as their height and net area, main purpose and configuration, was included for each property. Moreover, this data set has an interface to the population register and allowed, therefore, for retrieving the number of primary residents for each building. With the exception of sacral buildings, an economic module was used to compute the monetary value of buildings using (a) the information of the building register such as building type, number of storeys and utilisation, and (b) regionally averaged construction costs.},

Of particular significance in this context is the need for a comprehensive quantitative theory of channel networks in three dimensions reflecting the constraints of space filling and available potential energy as well as climatic, hydrologic and geologic controls which are in dynamical equilibrium with channel network forms. Recent progress related to these issues is discussed in a nontechnical way and illustrated with examples, and important open problems are identified. Â© 1988.},

  abstract = {Field studies in watershed hydrology continue to characterize and catalogue the enormous heterogeneity and complexity of rainfall runoff processes in more and more watersheds, in different hydroclimatic regimes, and at different scales. Nevertheless, the ability to generalize these findings to ungauged regions remains out of reach. In spite of their apparent physical basis and complexity, the current generation of detailed models is process weak. Their representations of the internal states and process dynamics are still at odds with many experimental findings. In order to make continued progress in watershed hydrology and to bring greater coherence to the science, we need to move beyond the status quo of having to explicitly characterize or prescribe landscape heterogeneity in our (highly calibrated) models and in this way reproduce process complexity and instead explore the set of organizing principles that might underlie the heterogeneity and complexity. This commentary addresses a number of related new avenues for research in watershed science, including the use of comparative analysis, classification, optimality principles, and network theory, all with the intent of defining, understanding, and predicting watershed function and enunciating important watershed functional traits.},

  abstract = {Debris flows are at the interface of several research directions dealing with natural hazards processes. It is therefore not surprising that methods for the prediction of flow and runout of debris flows have similarities to approaches originally developed for snow or debris avalanches and streamflow hydraulics (KÃ¶rner 1980; Lied and Bakkehoi 1980; Perla et al. 1980; Iverson 1997). However, debris-flow volume and bulk flow behaviour may change during travel through the channel, e.g. by entrainment of loose sediment and/or incorporation of water from a tributary. At present, no generally applicable model is able to cover the range of all possible material mixtures and event scenarios. This complexity results in different torrential processes and results in a large variety of approaches to predict debris-flow mobility.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a brief overview of geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH) theories and analyze their successful path without hiding their limitations. The history of the GIUH is subdivided into three major sections. The first is based on the milestone works of RodrÃ­guez-Iturbe and ValdÃ©s (Water Resources Research 1979; 15(6): 1409-1420) and Gupta et al. (Water Resources Research 1980; 16(5): 855-862), which recognized that a treatment of water discharges with 'travel times' could provide a rich interpretation of the theory of the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH). We show how this was possible, what assumptions were made, which of these assumptions can be relaxed, and which have become obsolete and been discarded. The second section focuses on the width-function-based IUH (WFIUH) approach and its achievements in assessing the interplay of the topology and geometry of the network with water dynamics. The limitations of the WFIUH approach are described, and a way to work around them is suggested. Finally, a new formal approach to estimating the water budget by 'travel times', which derives from a suitable use of the water budget equation and some hypotheses, has been introduced and disentangled.

  abstract = {This paper describes the development of snow avalanche dynamics models (restricted to the flow type) from the 1930s in the former Soviet Union up to 1999, when the last catastrophic avalanche winter in the European Alps occurred. The scope cannot be a comprehensive history; the paper is not much more than a selection of topics which I think are essential for avalanche hazard mapping. Emphasis is given to the different assumptions taken as a basis for models, which seems decisive for a success. The rest-analytical or numerical calculations-is routine work and not real research. Calibration of models by numerous field observations in different topography, climate and involved mass is an important aspect of application. To observe avalanches in only one avalanche path helps to some extent, but is certainly unsatisfactory. The presented models are allâ€”up to the present dayâ€”somehow uncertain. Therefore, only relative simple models with few parameters are significant. An increase of complexity of models does not necessarily mean an increase of accuracy or a better hazard mitigation strategy.},

  abstract = {To place geomorphology upon sound foundations for quantitative research into fundamental principles, it is proposed that geomorphic processes be treated as gravitational or molecular shear stresses acting upon elastic, plastic, or fluid earth materials to produce the characteristic varieties of strain, or failure, that constitute weathering, erosion, transportation and deposition.Shear stresses affecting earth materials are here divided into two major categories: gravitational and molecular. Gravitational stresses activate all downslope movements of matter, hence include all mass movements, all fluvial and glacial processes. Indirect gravitational stresses activate wave- and tide- induced currents and winds. Phenomena of gravitational shear stresses are subdivided according to behavior of rock, soil, ice, water, and air as elastic or plastic solids and viscous fluids. The order of classification is generally that of decreasing internal resistance to shear and, secondarily, of laminar to turbulent flow.Molecular stresses are those induced by temperature changes, crystallization and melting, absorption and desiccation, or osmosis. These stresses act in random or unrelated directions with respect to gravity. Surficial creep results from combination of gravitational and molecular stresses on a slope. Chemical processes of solution and acid reaction are considered separately.A fully dynamic approach requires analysis of geomorphic processes in terms of clearly defined open systems which tend to achieve steady states of operation and are self-regulatory to a large degree. Formulation of mathematical models, both by rational deduction and empirical analysis of observational data, to relate energy, mass, and time is the ultimate goal of the dynamic approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract Mechanical reinforcement which stabilizes soil on slopes has been attributed to plant roots. To measure such reinforcement, direct shear tests were made on 25-cm diameter root-permeated soil columns. Roots of alfalfa (Medicago sativa), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa), each increased the shear resistance of homogeneous and compacted layers of silty clay loam at 30-cm depth. One-year-old alfalfa had a much greater reinforcing effect than pine trees 16 months after transplanting or barley at its maximum growth. Barley had a greater effect in the clay loam than pine, but its effectiveness decreased as depth increased from 15 to 30 to 45 cm. Alfalfa roots were more effective than either pine or barley roots in increasing the resistance to shearing between a dense gravel-sand layer (simulating weathered rock) and the overlying soil, increasing shearing resistance to as much as 5 times that of fallow soil. A model is presented of soil reinforced by nonrigid roots. Calculations are given of slope safety factor increases from root reinforcement.},

  abstract = {The stability of slopes before and after removal of forest cover was investigated. Porewater pressures and shear strengths were measured and the soil properties were determined by laboratory and in situ tests. A model of the soil–root system was developed to evaluate the contribution of tree roots to shear strength. The computed safety factors are in general agreement with observed behaviors of the slopes. Decay of tree roots subsequent to logging was found to cause a reduction in the shear strength of the soil–root system.},
